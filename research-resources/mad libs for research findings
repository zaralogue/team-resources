My former colleage at AnswerLab, Beth Lingard, is now a manager at Facebook. She introduced me to this [Mad Libs style findings framework[(https://medium.com/facebook-research/stronger-findings-the-mad-libs-way-5ab14845ad3e) when we worked in consulting and I still find it helpful. Maybe you will, too!
